# data-structures
Repo to hold all the practice data structure implementations from `Data Structures and Algorithms` by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser.

I use python and java to create the datastructures where it makes sense -- doesn't make sense to make an arraylist in python.

Usually for the more complex datastructures I use python first then move to java afterwords.
