# data-structures
Repo to hold all the practice data structure implementations from `Data Structures and Algorithms` by Goodrich, Tamassia, and Goldwasser.

I use python and java to create the data structures where it makes sense -- doesn't make sense to make an ArrayList in python.

Usually, for the more complex data structures, I use python first then move to java afterward.
